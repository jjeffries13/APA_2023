### Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Representing change in longitudinal data can involve complex techniques and decisions about oneâ€™s model. A common method is linear growth modeling (LGCM) which models raw scores. Latent change scores (LCS) modeling transcends LGCM by portraying residualized change (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted values). Augmenting an LGCM with LCS could identify trajectories of growth while eliciting intervals of time associated with significant change in an outcome. A univariate LGCM with LCS was employed on existing data derived from an intervention aimed at enhancing student and family social capital (SC; e.g., shared values, trust, and mutual expectations). The Families and Schools Together program is a three-year intervention used to empower parents, build connections between families and schools, and create community support. Using cluster-randomized controlled trials, the program was employed in 26 elementary schools (*n* = 1,592) while 26 other schools (*n* = 1,492) served as the control. Model fit values and chi-square difference tests identified the linear model as best-fitting when compared to quadratic or shape and form models. Adding LCS illustrated that only growth in SC between baseline and year one was significant. Parental depression also significantly reduced changes in SC during this interval but increased change occurring between years one and two. This study demonstrates that the LGCM alone deceivingly exhibited compelling increases in student SC while the LCS showed that intervention effects decayed after year one of implementation. This study seeks to express the power of incorporating LCS into LGCM for more authentic representations and comprehensive conclusions.
